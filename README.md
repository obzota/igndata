Analysis on IGN ranking of videogames


# First approach

Our initial goal is to determine if there are some temporal trends in the videogame industry ruled by the genre of the games.
For doing so, we took a dataset of [IGN](http://www.ign.com/games/reviews) reviews on videos games published since 20 years.

The dataset can be found on the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/egrinstein/20-years-of-games) website.
